# About
This repo is about making a simple unix commandline interpreter
It is meant to utilize all the kbnowledge of C that I have acquired
This excercise is part of my course at ALX

# Usage
clone the repo
compile the program using any posix compliant compiler
e.g. using the gcc compiler
`gcc *.c -o shell`
Then run it using the path to the executable `shell`

It runs on Unix systems only.
## strings.c
This file stores the string manipulation functions

# End
